# Hi there 👋
Oncology is actually really easy. Getting everything you need done without any issues, now that's hard. 

This is a collection of resources and information I've found helpful working in oncology over the years and I hope that it can serve as a reference for others to make life easier.

### Work Philosophy
* Everything is online: there's probably a form online, there's probably an online portal, there's probably a way to do whatever you want online. 
* Structure is efficiency: clearly defined roles and functions foster efficiency and streamline workflow.
