# FoundationOne CDx
FoundationOne CDx is a genomic profiling test for solid tumors, identifying molecular alterations to guide targeted and immunotherapy treatments. The test is integrated into OncoEMR and can easily be ordered like any other lab test. This is my preferred way of ordering the test as there are several benefits: 
* 90% of the form is prepopulated with the patient's information.
* Results are automatically uploaded to the patient's chart when they are ready. 
* Order is submitted when signed

## Required Documents
* [Specimen Release Form](https://assets.ctfassets.net/w98cd481qyp0/7JzKC8TNALu7FWAcxsziqb/374fbe590e03b2d5decab38d05777e27/Specimen_Release_Consent_Form.pdf) - Patient's signature is required to allow FoundationOne to obtain the specimen from facility. I obtain this everytime to avoid delays. 
* [FoundationOne ABN](https://assets.ctfassets.net/w98cd481qyp0/2sDK3JAu6WQrGirc2OnAcr/e9a477779c3e75525c2847a36e44c722/Medicare_ABN_INTERACTIVE_ABNEnglish_01312026_508_DIGITAL.pdf) - Only required if Medicare insurance. 
* [No Surprise Bill](/assets/docs/nsb.pdf) - Only required if specimen is at Northwell Health facility.
