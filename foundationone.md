# FoundationOne CDx
FoundationOne CDx is a genomic profiling test for solid tumors, identifying molecular alterations to guide targeted and immunotherapy treatments. The test is integrated into OncoEMR and can easily be ordered like any other lab test. This is my preferred method of ordering the test. The electronic form is prepopulated on OncoEMR and the results are directly uploaded into the chart when they are ready.
